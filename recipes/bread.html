    <h2>White Bread</h2>
    <p>This was given to me by an Amish lady</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 Cups Warm Water</li>
        <li>2/3 Cup White Sugar</li>
        <li>1 1/2 Tablespoon Active Dry Yeast</li>
        <li>1/4 Cup Vegetable Oil</li>
        <li>1 1/2 Teaspoon Salt</li>
        <li>6 Cups Bread Flour</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Dissolve sugar in warm water in a large bowl, and then stir in yeast. Allow to proof until yeast resembles a creamy foam, 5 to 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Mix oil and salt into the yeast. Mix in flour one cup at a time. Knead dough on a lightly floured surface until smooth. Place in a well-oiled bowl, and turn dough to coat. Cover with a damp cloth. Allow to rise until doubled in bulk, about 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Punch dough down. Knead for a few minutes, and divide in half. Shape into loaves, and place into two well-oiled 9x5-inch loaf pans. Allow to rise until dough has topped the pans by one inch, about 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Bake the risen loaves in the preheated oven until golden brown for 30 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
